JuPyter Lab Notebook and Mathplotlib are used as the Web UI - as such it can be hosted on any web platform. ANother possibility is to use the Django widget for Mathplotlib

Due to shortage of time, JuPyter Widget with multiple selection of list items has not been implemented (currently only one specific or all timeseries from a chosen dataset can be selected)
from the 2 dedicated Combobox UI Widgets, but it should be already clear that the support for multiple selection and slicing of group of of time 
series is implemented in the code of the python lib supporting the JuPyter Notebook
